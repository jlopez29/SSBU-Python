As grounded meteor smashes can no longer be teched, down aerial can also set up for effective aerial combos, including into a second down aerial as a KO combo.

It can deal damage in two ways: upon contact at the end of the jump, or by pressing either the attack button or special button during the jump. Upon contact, Zero Suit Samus performs a footstool stomp, which buries grounded opponents and meteor smashes aerial opponents. Pressing the attack or special buttons makes her perform a diagonal flying kick, which is very powerful. The flying kick also has a sweetspot at her foot that can meteor smash aerial opponents, but has slightly less knockback against aerial opponents.\r ",

The pillar will slowly drift downwards if it hits an aerial opponent, allowing it to function as an edgeguard if it hits an enemy near a ledge. It is otherwise a useful deterring tool, and can start combos from careless approaches.\r  Custom 1 -  Stealth Burst: Fires a small shining energy shot that detonates when the button is released, similarly to Zelda's Din's Fire but only traveling straight. As the name suggests, Stealth Burst is very hard to telegraph due to how small its particle effect is, making it useful for mindgames and edgeguarding. Holding the button gives the shot more distance and power before detonating. Using it in the air will slow the Gunner's fall speed momentarily. All charge levels have KO potential, with no-charge/fully-charged Stealth Bursts KOing at around 133%/110%.

Each missile travels a different distance, with the homing variant traveling more than half of Final Destination, and the super variant traveling almost the stage's full length. The homing missiles have decent homing capabilities, while the super missiles speed up after an initial pause and have good KO potential, able to KO Mario at the edge of Final Destination from 120%.

If the knee connects against an opponent, the Brawler will perform a series of blows (a knee strike, a kick with the opposite leg, a backhanded punch, a swinging fist punch with the opposite arm, a double-hitting axe kick, and a double-fisted axe handle swing) concluded by a backflip kick. If whiffed, there is noticeable endlag. In the air, even after attacking, Onslaught leaves the Brawler helpless. It has excellent KO potential, as it can KO grounded opponents as early as 110%. However, whenever the move is successful, each consecutive use of the move will cause its power to decrease. Onslaught will go back to full power after some time, indicated by a brief flash of purple sparkles on the Brawler's shoes. Despite in-game descriptions, accumulated damage doesn't affect the strength of the move, nor does it hasten the reset speed.  Custom 1 - Burning Dropkick: Extends both legs in front of themself, charging forward to deliver a dropkick while covered with flames. Unlike the previous iteration of this move, it is no longer chargable, so it deals set damage. Furthermore, it now covers a set, albeit vastly reduced distance, and can now miss entirely if started right next to an opponent. As a result, it has lost majority of its utility from Smash 4, though it is still an effective approach move due to its quick startup, and can also KO at high percents.  Custom 2 - Suplex:A command grab in which the Brawler dashes forward a short distance with their arms out in a grabbing motion. If it connects, the Brawler will lift the opponent into the air and do a backwards suplex, slamming the opponent headfirst into the ground. The Brawler gains super armor while throwing an opponent. Any opponents nearby for the grab and slam will take collateral damage. The move has extremely low knockback scaling, but can be used to effectively rack up damage. If used in midair, the move causes helplessness; it can grab foes near an edge and drag them off as a Sacrificial KO, though",

Bounces twice upon landing, which deals lower damage; if it misses, the shot travels a set distance before disappearing. Very damaging and strong for an unchargeable projectile, which makes for a useful edgeguarding tool.  Custom 1 - Flashing Mach Punch: The Brawler performs five fast punches with a single hand. If any of these punches land, the move will extend into a flurry of consecutive punches, the maximum total being 22. The last hit deals good vertical knockback, KOing at around 115%. If the move lands on an opponent, the Brawler gains invincibility for the duration of the move, making the move hard to interrupt. However, the move has punishable startup and ending lag (starts on frame 15 and ends on frame 59 if missed). If the first hits are shielded or hits an opponents under the effects of armor, it will not transition to the looping portion of the move.  Custom 2 - Exploding Side Kick: Stands on one leg and charges their leg in flame, before unleashing a powerful burning kick. The move can be reversed once anytime during the move; the window to do so is extremely lenient compared to other moves of its kind, allowing the Brawler to turn around right before the kick itself. The Brawler gains armor just before the kick, even if started in midair, allowing it to function as a hard punish.

If performed in the air, the Brawler will just perform the headbutt. On the ground, the initial leap sends the opponent into the main headbutt. In both versions of the move, the descending headbutt hits multiple times, and acts as a meteor smash. If the grounded version is used as a sacrificial KO, the opponent will be KO'd first. The grounded hit is very powerful and can KO consistently at 120%, though it is extremely risky due to its overall lag. If performed in midair while facing a ledge, the Brawler will be able to sweetspot said ledge, allowing it to be used as an edgeguard. The move does a high amount of shield damage, being able to break full shields if both hits connect.  Custom 1 - Feint Jump: Flips off the ground and, when the special button is pressed again, performs a divekick while surrounded by a blue aura. The startup offers brief intangibility. Similarly to Zero Suit Samus's Flip Jump, by landing on an opponent midair during the jump, the Brawler will automatically perform a kick which meteor smashes foes. The angle they are launched, however, is more diagonal, similar to that of Ryu's down air. The direction they are sent is opposite of the direction of the flip (i.e flipping to the right will diagonally meteor smash the opponent to the left, and vice versa). Both the jump and the kick can be reversed if the player taps in the other direction upon startup.  Custom 2 - Counter Throw: The Brawler enters a defensive stance, bringing their arms close to their face. Upon being hit, the Brawler will counterattack by grabbing the opponent and slamming them on the ground behind themself. The slam will lightly damage nearby opponents. Unlike other counters, Counter Throw has a short duration, but low ending lag, allowing it to be used more flexibly.

Both hits transition quickly, and the landing hit has enough knockback to KO at around 120% near the edge of Final Destination.  Custom 1 - Helicopter Kick: Performs a flurry of spinning kicks while traveling diagonally upward, similar to Fox's forward aerial. The trajectory of Helicopter Kick's final hit can be altered: holding forward will make its knockback diagonal, while holding back will make its knockback more vertical. This allows the Brawler to choose how to launch the opponent. Allows for long horizontal recovery, but lacks vertical lift. While it is still an excellent combo finisher out of aerials or a throw, it is unable to KO extremely early near the sides of the stage.  Custom 2 - Thrust Uppercut: The Brawler rises upwards with a multi-hitting uppercut, at a slight diagonal trajectory. The uppercut is followed by a second uppercut with the opposite fist. By angling during the ascent, it is possible to travel further horizontally, though the move has deceptively low recovery distance due to the move's animation. Like Helicopter Kick, Thrust Uppercut is a reliable combo finisher due to its speed, though its trajectory is more suitable for ending vertical combos.  ",

Holding the button has Bayonetta fire her guns from her hands and feet; hitting anyone directly above or below, to her sides, and slightly diagonally under her. With precise timing (a 3 frame window to be exact), a Double Jump can be cancelled into Witch Twist, thereby saving her jump in a similar way to Smash 4. This drastically improves her combo game and enables some particularly powerful ladder combos, as well as some much needed recovery mix-ups. This can be executed with both the first and second Witch Twists (as long as the double jump is unused) only to use the double jump right after, essentially giving her a maximum of three midair jumps, though only one would reach the top of its arch.",
